 Q1(test1.cpp):   A uniprocessor system has n number of CPU intensive processes, each process has its own requirement of CPU burst. The process with lowest CPU burst is given the highest priority. A late-arriving higher priority process can preempt a currently running process with lower priority. Simulate a scheduler that is scheduling the processes in such a way that higher priority process is never starved due to the execution of lower priority process. What should be its average waiting time and average turnaround time if no two processes are arriving are arriving at same time.
 
 
 
 Q2(test2.cpp): The Sleeping-Barber Problem. A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n chairs and a barber room with one barber chair. If there are no customers to be served the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all chairs are occupied then the customer leaves the shop. If the barber is busy but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs. If the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber. Write a program to coordinate the barber and the customers.
